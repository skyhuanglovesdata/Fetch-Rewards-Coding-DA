Dear Stakeholders,

  Hope you are doing well!

  I was working with the **Receipts, Users, Brands** dataset and conducted some 
  general data cleaning with python. Then, I examined the data quality and noticed
  some data quality issues that I want to discuss with you.

  First of all, I find out lots duplicate values for the User ID in the **Users** 
  datasets. The duplicate user id may cause mistakes in future query results and lead 
  to inaccurate analysis. I think we should remove the duplicate users and I need more 
  information about those users to see if I need to differentiate those duplicate users 
  or just keep the most rencet active ones.  

  Second, there are lots of null values for the date information. I wonder if the datasets
  is missing information from specific dates so that I might replace those null values
  with some estimated dates. 

  After all, I also suggest that we may distinguish the variable **rewardsReceiptItemList** 
  as a new  table which would bring effciecncy in future analysis. I attached my idea for the 
  relational database design with this message. 

  If you have any questions for me or concerns about the data, please reach out to me. 
  I would love to meet with you and have a deeper conversation about these datasets.

Best,
Xiangyu
