Part 2 :
Q1 :What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?
  - I design a new table for the rewardsReceiptItemList and use the receipt ID to join withReceipts Table and barcode to join the Brands Table
  - MySQL query

WITH brand_cnt_table AS (
  SELECT
    b.name , COUNT(DISTINCT r._id) AS cnt
  FROM
    Receipts r 
  JOIN
    rewardsReceiptItemList rl ON r._id = rl.receipt_id 
  JOIN
    Brand b ON rl.barcode = b.barcode 
  WHERE
    Year(createDate) = Year(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) 
    AND
    Month(createDate) = Month(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) 
  GROUP BY 
    b.name ),
    
  rank_table AS (
  SELECT
    name, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY cnt DESC) AS rk
  FROM
    brand_cnt_table
) 

SELECT
  name 
FROM
  brand_cnt_table WHERE
rk <= 5;

# Since I use dense_rank above, there will be no gap for the tied values. And this may include more than 5 brands because of tie ranks.
